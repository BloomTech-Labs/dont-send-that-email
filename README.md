Don't Send That Email!
=====================


*Donâ€™t Send That Email* helps users send messages to coworkers, family or friends that convey the right tone. Sometimes it's hard to intepret the emotional message of an email or text.
DSTE uses an AI to preview the emotional tone of a message. Users can avoid sending a work email that sounds too casual. They can send personal messages that avoid negativity or hostility.
This puts a barrier between you and a bad email or messaging experience. We'll help you send a good email that conveys the right emotional tone.


##### Set up instructions

To clone the app to your local machine, follow these instructions.

1.  Go to your command line and type `git clone https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/dont-send-that-email.git`
  This will clone the app onto your local machine.

2. `cd` into `dont-send-that-email`. You will find two directories. `client` and `server` 
  In both directories you need to type `npm install` to get all the libraries that help run the app.

3. In both the `client` and `server` directories you need to create a file called `.env`. It has to have the period before `env`.

4. In the `.env` files you will need to copy and paste the secret keys we use in the app.

5. You will need to make three accounts for three keys. See below on how to get these keys.
  * The Watson API key
  * The Stripe key
  * Auth0 key

6. In the `server` directory you need to get Knex. It's a library we use to manage our databases.
  Get it by typing `npm intal knex`. This will install knex so you can install the database.

8. After you have Knex. In the `server` directory type `knex migrate:latest`.

7. Once you have your keys copied into the `.env` file in both `client` and `server` directories, you can run `npm start` in both directories.
  You should see `Server running on port: 5000` in the `server` directory.
  You should see `something` in the `client` directory.




Before you can run the app locally, you need some secret keys that make the run behind the scenes.

Keys needed
