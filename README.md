Don't Send That Email!
=====================


*Donâ€™t Send That Email* helps users send messages to coworkers, family or friends that convey the right tone. Sometimes it's hard to intepret the emotional message of an email or text.
DSTE uses an AI to preview the emotional tone of a message. Users can avoid sending a work email that sounds too casual. They can send personal messages that avoid negativity or hostility.
This puts a barrier between you and a bad email or messaging experience. We'll help you send a good email that conveys the right emotional tone.
